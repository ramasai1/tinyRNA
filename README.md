# tinyRNA
An effort to discover a new class of RNAs using existing bioinformatics methods and tools in nonstandard ways. 

Internship project over the summer to investigate more into microRNA datasets and perform analyses on them to find out trends
in data and figure out if a new class of RNAs exist. Work done by Ramasai Tadepalli and Kevin Joo.
